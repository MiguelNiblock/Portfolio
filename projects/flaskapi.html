			<h2>Context</h2>
			<p>At Gaming Analytics, we're always looking for better ways to provide valuable data insights to our casino customers. This project started with the attempt to answer the question <i>How to statistically explain which factors/ metrics contributed to a day's change in revenue? </i> As often is the case with good questions, solving this problem led to various sub-problems, each of which needed its own independently-running procedure to solve. Since I was going to be developing several of these backend tools in the months to come, I looked for ways to provide the team with a clean and straightforward programming interface (API) that could serve GET requests with functionalities expected of various sub-modules. Each submodule would be accessible at a dedicated endpoint with the module name. The request body would include the data to be processed, and the response would include the processed data. Python was the team's primary language in the backend, so Flask quickly became the obvious choice. While a Docker container would've been a possible choice for the task, the simplicity of the FlaskAPI solution was the luring; not to say it was the path of least resistance. My teammates agreed.</p>
			<p>Three related submodules were served by the Flask API in total. Although this article is mostly about the Flask API, I will briefly discuss the functionality of these modules and provide an example of an API call; All while maintaining confidentiality and avoid revealing any trade secrets ;)</p>

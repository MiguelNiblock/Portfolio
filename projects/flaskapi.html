			<h2>Context</h2>
			<p>At Gaming Analytics, we're always looking for better ways to provide valuable data insights to our casino customers. This project started with the attempt to answer the question <i>How to statistically explain which factors/ metrics contributed to a day's change in revenue? </i> As often is the case with good questions, solving this problem led to various sub-problems, each of which needed its own independently-running procedure to solve. Since I was going to be developing several of these backend tools in the months to come, I looked for ways to provide the team with a clean and straightforward programming interface (API) that could serve GET requests with functionalities expected of various sub-modules. Each submodule would be accessible at a dedicated endpoint with the module name. The request body would include the data to be processed, and the response would include the processed data. Python was the team's primary language in the backend, so Flask quickly became the obvious choice. While a Docker container would've been a possible choice for the task, the simplicity of the FlaskAPI solution was the luring; not to say it was the path of least resistance. My teammates agreed.</p>
			<h2>Working Example</h2>
			<p>Three related submodules were served by the Flask API in total. Although this article is mostly about the Flask API, I will briefly discuss the functionality of these modules and provide an example of an API call; All while maintaining confidentiality and avoid revealing any trade secrets ;). The following is a static render of a Jupyter Notebook where I send a get request to my local Flask server, and show the response as a Pandas' DataFrame.</p>
			<iframe class="jupyter" src="Request_SingleRankMetrics.html" width="100%" height="400" style="border:1px solid black;">
			</iframe>
			<p>In this demo, we are sending a GET request to endpoint <code>'http://localhost:5000/singlerankmetrics'</code>. And along with it, we are sending a data object in JSON-form which contains the parameters of our request. These parameters are basically what we are asking the module to answer for us.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>'path'</code> is the URL to a file which contains a Pandas Dataframe, which contains the data the module will work with. The specific data format depends on the module in question. But for the three modules, it was usually a small Dataframe that includes only the minimum data necessary for the module to operate. The output of cell #3 shows a preview of the data to be handed to the module, in this case, the object 'assetdata'.</li>
				<li>In this particular case, the <code>SingleRankMetrics</code> module is meant to indicate which were the top contributing metrics to an asset's change in revenue(referred to as 'coinIn'). Other related modules answered similar, but technically different questions such as: <code>GroupRankMetrics</code>: <i>Which metrics contributed to change in a given<code>metric_col</code>, among a group of assets?(Assets are casino machines which are often grouped in banks, or casino zones)</i>, and <code>GroupRankDimensions</code>: <i>Which assets contributed most to the change in a given <code>metric_col</code>, among a group of assets?</i></li>
				<li><code>metric_col</code>: Refers to the metric whose change we want to explain. Revenue, expressed as 'coinIn' is the most common use of these modules, since the other metrics are thought to be contributors to revenue, and we are assuming a causal relationship. But it's technically possible to frame the question in reverse.</li>
				<li><code>date_target</code>: Refers to the date whose change we want to explain. In the demo, it's July 17, 2019. We are using data aggregated at the daily level because hourly variations are of a different nature, and the seasonal patterns that apply to day series are different than those that govern hourly variation. The modules that handle this request generally identify the 'day-of-week' of the day series provided and compare the value/s in the <code>date_target</code> with the value/s in the previous date with the same 'day-of-week'. You don't compare a Friday to a Monday, and so on.</li>
				<li>Finally, <code>metric_col</code> and<code>date_col</code> just refer to the column name in the Dataframe which contain the request data. This is necessary to correctly parse the input data. <code>metric_col</code> in this case would refer to 'coinIn'.</li>
				<li><code>method</code> has nothing to do with HTTP methods. In these modules, we wanted to find out which metrics/dimensions contributed most to a given change in either positive or negative impact to revenue. So when we pass the value <code>bestranks</code> to this method parameter, we are saying that the results should be sorted from greates to least contribution to revenue. The modules used covariances to make this determination. If the change in <code>metric_col</code> was positive, then the metrics/dimensions with positive covariance are the 'best', and viceversa.</li>

## Context

During my time as an intern at Gaming Analytics, one of the obstacles faced by the team was the sometimes unimpressive accuracy of the forecasting model in production. Apparently it had been developed by a previous employee whose approach was one-of-a-kind and cryptic, and thus not worth trying to patch. So my task was to develop a forecasting module from scratch, that could improve accuracy and be more maintainable.

After much experimentation and input from colleagues, I arrived at a novel and relatable approach that would combine two great algorithms: Holt Winters, and Facebook's Prophet.

```python
import pandas as pd
string = "string"
num = 1234
```
